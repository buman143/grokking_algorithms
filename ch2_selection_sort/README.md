### Recap

- When you want to store multiple elements, use an array or a linked list.
- With arrays, elements are stored next to each other.
- With linked lists, elements are stored in different places, and elements store the address of the next element.
- Arrays allow fast reads $O(1)$.
- Linked lists allow fast inserts and deletes $O(1)$.

| Action | Arrays | Linked Lists |
|--------|--------|--------------|
|Read | $O(1)$ | $O(n)$       |
|Insert | $O(n)$ | $O(1)$ |
|Delete | $O(n)$ | $O(1)$ |
