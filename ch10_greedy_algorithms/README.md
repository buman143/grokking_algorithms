### Recap

- Greedy algorithms optimize locally, with the idea of ending up with a global optimum.
- If you have an NP-hard problem, it's best to use an approximation algorithm.
- Greedy algorithms are easy to write and fast to run, so they are good approximations.

The general idea of a greedy algorithm is to iteratively find the best solution until a stopping case is reached.
